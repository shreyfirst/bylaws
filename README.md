CHAPTER ONE
DEFINITION AND ADOPTION OF BYLAWS

DEFINITION OF BYLAWS
The ASUCD Bylaws serve to define the rules of order directly concerning the operation and duties of the ASUCD Senate, the subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate and all other ASUCD entities. The ASUCD Bylaws also outline the policies and procedures concerning the general operation of the ASUCD.
ADOPTION OF BYLAWS
The ASUCD Senate and its subordinate bodies shall consider the ASUCD Bylaws as adopted at every meeting. A Senate Bill passed by a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate may amend the ASUCD Bylaws. The ASUCD Senate shall consider all Bylaws that deal with operations and practices of the ASUCD outside of senate meetings as adopted, until such Bylaws are amended or suspended by the ASUCD Senate.
BYLAW STRUCTURE
The ASUCD Bylaws shall not include any binary gender references. All Bylaws shall not include any  gender references that may not be the preference of all members of the ASUCD.
SUSPENSION
An ASUCD Bylaw(s) may be suspended for a particular purpose (to be stated in conjunction with the motion) by a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire Senate.
CONFLICTING BYLAWS
No ASUCD Bylaw is in order when it conflicts with the ASUCD Constitution. In the event that two (2) or more Bylaws conflict, the most recently adopted Bylaw(s) shall take precedence over the older Bylaw(s). Members of the ASUCD must report any conflicting Bylaws to the Internal Affairs Commission immediately. If conflict exists or arises between the ASUCD Bylaws and any relevant state or federal law, then the state or federal law shall be checked and followed without exception.












CHAPTER TWO
CODE OF ETHICS

INTRODUCTION
Serving as an elected or appointed official of the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis mandates the responsibility to represent the students of the University of California. Elements of this responsibility include:
Adhering to all university policies and the ASUCD governing and procedural documents, as well as an obligation to disclose knowledge of potential violations of these policies and documents;
Refraining from interfering in the administration of the ASUCD and its ability to function;
Committing to upholding personal integrity and opposing all forms of discrimination, harassment, and unfair treatment of any form;
Remaining civically engaged as a positive member of the community;
In one’s capacity as a member of the ASUCD, only acting in the public interest and not for personal gain.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
This chapter may be referred to and cited as the “Associated Students of the University of California, Davis Ethics Code,” or by its short title, the “Code of Ethics”.
VIOLATIONS DEFINED
The following may be considered Ethics Violations by which elected officials and appointed officials can be charged with:
Bias: A predisposition or a preconception that prevents an individual from impartially evaluating facts previously presented for determination in such a way as to discriminate against another individual or group of individuals on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, or culture.
Bribery: The act of offering, giving, and/or receiving any item or reward of value in an attempt to influence the actions of an ASUCD Executive, Legislative and/or Judicial member.
Coercion: Any action or verbal threat meant to be used as leverage to force another member of the ASUCD Legislative, Executive and/or Judicial bodies to act in a way contrary to their own interests.
Conflicts of Interest: A situation in which an individual has a duty to more than one person or organization insofar as they would be unable to render a verdict that is constitutional and adheres to the Bylaws.
Misuse of Appropriations: The act of using any Senate appropriations for any purpose beyond those declared when approved by the Senate.
Forgery: The act of signing another individual’s name onto an ASUCD document without the consent of that individual.
Defamation: A statement that injures a third party's reputation in a public forum and is based on false or privileged information.
Violation of Confidentiality: Willfully participating in the invasion of privacy of another by divulging the identity of individual(s) involved in a closed session or the facts of a closed session through a public forum or publication.
Failure to Perform Duties: Continuous and willful failure to fulfill duties and responsibilities for a position as outlined in the ASUCD Constitution and Bylaws. Failure to communicate regarding the fulfillment of duties to the relevant supervisory officer and/or body shall constitute a failure of those duties.
Unsatisfactory Attendance: Neglecting one’s responsibility to attend required meetings and events for one’s position as outlined in the ASUCD Constitution and in the chapter on Quorum and Attendance at Meetings, without having been excused by the presiding officer.
CONFLICTING MEMBERSHIP IN THE ASUCD SENATE, SUBORDINATE BODIES OF THE ASUCD SENATE, ASUCD EXECUTIVE OFFICE, AND STUDENT GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE (SGAO)
Under Article I of the ASUCD Constitution, no individual shall concurrently hold both an elected ASUCD position and an appointed ASUCD position requiring confirmation by the ASUCD Senate.
Under Article I of the ASUCD Constitution, only undergraduate ASUCD members shall hold an appointed office requiring confirmation by the ASUCD Senate.
No person may be a member of more than three (3) subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate; except where a position necessitates membership on another subordinate body as stated in the ASUCD Bylaws or legislation enacted. This provision does not apply to members of Special Committees. Anyone confirmed to more than three (3) subordinate bodies (not within the exceptions above) shall be automatically resigned from all positions on said subordinate bodies except for the position for which the person was most recently confirmed.
A person shall serve on no more than one (1) commission but shall have the option of serving on three (3) committees or one (1) commission and two (2) committees.
No person shall serve on two (2) subordinate bodies whose purposes conflict. Both chairs shall be notified in this event and the applicant shall be notified if their request to serve has been denied for this reason. The chair may deny candidates for a conflict at their discretion.
Individuals must abstain from all matters pertaining to any legislation and/or allocation involving a committee in which they serve.
With the exception of ASUCD Unit Directors and Administrative Advisory Committees undergraduate members(s), no appointed ASUCD official requiring senate confirmation may serve as a member of any subordinate body of the ASUCD Senate.

CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION
Consideration of legislation by the ASUCD Senate
Any legislation reported as a noncontroversial bill by all of the ASUCD Commission(s) to which it was sent shall be placed on the ASUCD Consent Calendar of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the ASUCD Senate if there is no objection to do so from the author.
Any legislation that receives a recommendation of “Do Pass,” “Do Pass, as amended,” or “No Recommendation” by at least one-half (½) of the ASUCD Commission(s) to which it was sent, shall be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the ASUCD Senate. If a commission authors legislation, their authoring vote denotes a “Do Pass,” and shall be included in the count of recommendations.
Legislation that receives a recommendation of “Do Not Pass” or “Do Not Pass, as amended” by more than one-half (½) of the commission(s) to which it was sent may only be considered by the Senate if revived by two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate within two (2) weeks of receiving its final commission recommendation. “Died/Killed in Commission” shall categorize any bill which failed to pass a revival vote.
For the ASUCD Senate to consider a spending bill, the bill must include the following:
An itemized budget: This must include specific costs for specific items and should include appropriate quotes, receipts, and a list of other sources of funding, when available. The itemized budget must also explicitly state funds that originate from the ASUCD General Fund with the term “ASUCD” and include a line item noting the total amount of ASUCD General Fund monies already allocated to the proposal.
A background: This shall include the overall intent behind the request of withdrawing funds from the ASUCD Senate Reserves. The background of a spending bill shall include, but is not limited to:
Purpose: This shall include a description of the project.
Parties: This shall include mentions of an individual, group(s), or campus organization(s) that are involved in the project.
Timeline: In the case that a project is an event, this shall describe the immediate processes to take place if the money is allocated, including but not limited to:
The expected date that the event shall take place;
The individual(s) responsible for ensuring that the allocation of funds is properly disbursed;
Expected attendance.
Recurrence: This shall address whether the spending bill is a one-time request. If it is not, this shall describe how frequently this request is expected to be made.
A piece of legislation may be considered by the ASUCD Senate during any regularly scheduled meeting as “emergency” legislation pending a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate and approval from the ASUCD Presiding Officer, or by a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate. Prior to the Senate voting on whether to consider legislation as an “emergency,” the author(s) shall have no more than one (1) minute to present reasons for the urgency of the legislation.
“Emergency” legislation shall be defined as “a serious and unexpected situation” in need of immediate action that directly affects students of the University of California, Davis.
Only two (2) pieces of “emergency” legislation may be seen during each individual Senate meeting. The ASUCD Senate shall consider emergency legislation from an individual senator no more than once every quarter.
To ensure transparency, when “emergency legislation” gets introduced to the Senate, senators must submit “emergency” legislation to the ASUCD Presiding Officer and SGAO before their office closes every Thursday. For any “emergency” legislation submitted past the Thursday deadline, senators shall send the legislation to the ASUCD Presiding Officer, who shall make the legislation available to anyone who requests it.
In the event that more than two (2) pieces of “emergency” legislation are submitted in a single senate meeting, the discretion of which two (2) pieces of legislation are to be seen is up to a vote of the ASUCD Senate.
The ASUCD Internal Vice President shall maintain a record of the ASUCD Senators as they introduce “emergency” legislation throughout the quarter and ensure that they do not exceed the maximum specified in this chapter.
The ASUCD Senate may reconsider any legislation vetoed by the ASUCD President no later than the adjournment of the second (2nd) Senate meeting after the legislation originally passed the senate. The President shall submit the ASUCD President’s rationale for the veto on legislation (not to exceed two (2) pages) to the Senate, to be presented with the legislation when the Senate reconsiders it. The ASUCD Senate President Pro Tempore shall inform the Senate at the beginning of "Status of Legislation Previously Passed” on the status of bills passed the previous week.
The ASUCD President or designee shall inform the author of the bill of the veto prior to the ASUCD Senate meeting, at which the ASUCD Senate may reconsider it.
The vetoed bill shall be attached to the ASUCD Senate Agenda.
Consideration of legislation by subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate
Each ASUCD Commission Chairperson shall ensure that legislation is distributed to their respective commission prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting.
All subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate shall consider legislation at the first meeting after the legislation was placed on the agenda of the subordinate body for its consideration, unless the author or the author’s designee is not present to speak on behalf of the legislation and answer questions. If the author or the author’s designee misses the second scheduled subordinate body meeting after placing the legislation on its agenda, the legislation shall be considered withdrawn by the author.
ASUCD Commissions shall make a formal recommendation to the ASUCD Senate in one (1) of the following manners:  “Do Pass,” “Do Pass, as amended,” “No Recommendation,” “Do Not Pass,” or “Do Not Pass, as amended.” Legislation must receive a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Commission to receive a “Do Pass,” or “Do Pass, as amended,” a tie vote shall result in a “No Recommendation.”  An ASUCD Senate Bill that allocates ASUCD monies requires a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire commission to receive a “Do Pass” or “Do Pass, as amended”. An ASUCD Senate Bill which allocates ASUCD monies and receives a vote less than a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire commission shall receive a “Do Not Pass,” or a “Do Not Pass, as amended.”
Only those members in attendance for the discussion of a piece of legislation may cast a vote on that particular piece of legislation. If the chairperson of a commission determines that a member was absent for a significant aspect or duration of the discussion on a particular piece of legislation, that member’s vote shall be counted as an abstention. If an appropriate alternate member of the commission was present for the discussion, they may cast a vote for the voting member, as though the voting member is still absent (see chapter on the Subordinate Bodies of the Senate).
All other subordinate bodies of the ASUCD Senate must make informal recommendations to the ASUCD Senate in the exact same manner.
A subordinate body of the ASUCD Senate may, by a majority vote of the entire body, table (choose not to consider) a piece of legislation until the next regularly scheduled meeting of that body unless the Senate votes to consider it urgent. Tabling legislation for a second (2nd) week shall result in a "No Recommendation" recommendation.
When the ASUCD Senate assigns legislation to more than one (1) of its subordinate bodies, then the legislation may be considered at each within the same week; no two (2) commissions shall consider the same piece of legislation on the same day.
For any ASUCD Commission to consider a spending bill, the bill must include all components necessary for consideration by the ASUCD Senate.
Each subordinate body of the ASUCD Senate to which the ASUCD Senate referred a piece of legislation shall report its recommendation and outcome of votes taken on the legislation to the ASUCD Senate no later than the second (2nd) regularly scheduled ASUCD Senate meeting after the legislation was placed on the agenda of the subordinate body for its consideration. If a commission fails to report legislation by then, the legislation shallbe given a “No Recommendation” by that subordinate body. The ASUCD Senate may, at any time, by a majority vote of the entire senate, grant a subordinate body one (1) time extension, not to exceed two (2) weeks, for the consideration of a particular piece of legislation.
 After the adoption of any amendments made in the commission process, any bill reported as a noncontroversial bill by all relevant commission chairs shall be placed by the ASUCD Internal Vice President on the ASUCD Consent Calendar, and shall be known as a “Consent Calendar bill” if there is no objection to do so from the author.
Actions by the ASUCD Senate
The ASUCD Senate may table (choose not to consider) a piece of legislation and place it on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled ASUCD Senate meeting by a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate.
At any time the ASUCD Senate may refer or remove a referral of any legislation to any subordinate body of the ASUCD Senate by a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate.
The ASUCD Senate must remove a bill from the ASUCD Consent Calendar if (a) the bill amends during a senate meeting or (b) a senator or commission chair objects to the bill’s placement on the ASUCD Consent Calendar. Any bill removed from the ASUCD Consent Calendar shall be considered as regular legislation in the same meeting.
The ASUCD Senate may pass any piece of legislation or all bills in the ASUCD Consent Calendar by a majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate. Any Senate Bill that allocates ASUCD monies from the ASUCD Senate Reserve, Capital Reserve, or Technology Reserve, or adopts or revises the ASUCD Annual Budget may only be passed by a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the entire ASUCD Senate. Any ASUCD Senate Bill that places an ASUCD Ballot Measure before a vote of the ASUCD membership must be passed in accordance with the Chapter on the Elections Code.
Abstentions shall be recorded as either absences or present abstentions, reported with either (A) or (P) respectively after the number of each type.
All legislation shall take effect immediately upon enactment (by signature of the ASUCD President or the equivalent form of an enactment specified elsewhere in the ASUCD Bylaws or ASUCD Constitution) unless otherwise specified in the legislation. If the ASUCD President does not sign or veto the legislation within a week of its presentation, the legislation becomes law.
AMENDMENTS
The ASUCD Senate or any ASUCD Commission that considers a piece of legislation may amend that piece of legislation by a majority vote of the entire body.
All amendments shall adhere to the following guidelines when dealing with edits within legislation.
Once a piece of legislation has been considered by every commission to which it was assigned, no further edits shall be made until the legislation is considered at a regularly scheduled meeting of the ASUCD Senate, unless the author deems the edits urgent and necessary.
Any edits deemed urgent or necessary by the author(s) or co-author(s) before consideration of a piece of legislation by the senate shall be done with the approval of the chairs of the commissions to which the legislation was assigned. The commission chair(s) shall approve the edits in consultation with their commission members.
Commission chair(s) shall reserve the right to withdraw their commission’s recommendation from a piece of legislation during consideration of that legislation at a regularly scheduled ASUCD Senate meeting if the bill has been substantially altered/edited from the version upon which the commission voted. In this case, the withdrawal of a commission recommendation shall not prevent the Senate from considering the piece of legislation.
WITHDRAWAL OF LEGISLATION
To withdraw a piece of legislation, the author (or a co-author if the author is not present) shall give a statement to the presiding officer of the senate providing the reason why they withdrew the bill. The author or co-author may choose to give “no comment” as their reason. This statement shall be included in official records of the bill.
The author or theirthat author’s designee may withdraw the author’s legislation from consideration by the ASUCD Senate at any time.
In the case that an ASUCD Commission authored the legislation, the commission chairperson may withdraw the legislation or the commission may withdraw the legislation by a majority vote of the entire commission.
While in consideration of legislation during a senate meeting, the senator who introduced the legislation may withdraw the introduction of that legislation at any time. The chair of the meeting shall then ask if any other senator is willing to introduce the legislation. If a senator agrees to sponsor the legislation, that senator becomes the introducing senator and the ASUCD Senate remains in consideration of the legislation. If no senator(s) sponsors the legislation at this time, they withdraw the bill

Ballots
In the event that a Recall or ballot measure is placed on a ballot, the measures shall be listed before the candidate listings.
The listing of candidates or tickets for the same office on the ballot shall be randomly generated by a computer program for each iteration of the ballot.
Ballots shall ask the voters to rank the candidates they support in order of preference, with “1” or "1st" being the highest/most preferred. Voters may rank as many or as few candidates as they wish. Ballot instructions shall include a statement expressing the following idea to voters: “You do not hurt the chances of your higher-ranked candidates by ranking additional candidates.”
Voting Procedures
Only current undergraduate members of the ASUCD may vote in any ASUCD Election.
No voter may cast more than one (1) ballot in any ASUCD Election.
Any difficulties experienced while voting or suspected fraud should be reported to the Elections Committee.
Members of ASUCD may only cast their ballot on the official ASUCD Elections website.
Tabulation 
The Elections Committee shall oversee the tabulation of votes cast in every ASUCD Election held under the authority of the ASUCD Constitution and this chapter of the ASUCD Bylaws. The tabulation method, as stated in the ASUCD Constitution, shall be as follows:
Pursuant to the ASUCD Constitution, instant runoff voting (IRV) shall be used to elect the ASUCD President and Internal Vice President.
In instant runoff voting, the tabulation of votes proceeds in rounds. In each round, a value of one (1) vote is assigned to each voter’s highest remaining preference. For a ticket to be elected, the required number of votes is a majority of the votes in that round. If a voter’s preference is for a ticket with the lowest accrued vote total, that ticket is eliminated, and the vote is transferred to the next preferred ticket still in the running. This process is completed when one (1) ticket receives the required majority of votes.
Pursuant to the ASUCD Constitution, single transferable voting (STV) shall be used to elect the ASUCD Senators. Fractional transfer shall be used in this tabulation.
In single transferable voting with fractional transfer, the value of one (1) vote is assigned to each voter’s first preference. The quota for the election is the smallest number of votes necessary to elect the required number of candidates. A candidate is elected to a seat if that candidate has accrued a quota of the votes or if no surplus candidates remain. If a voter’s current preference is for a candidate who has received more than the quota for votes, the surplus value of that voter’s vote shall be transferred to that voter’s next eligible preference based on the proportion of the total votes accrued by that candidate. If a voter’s current preference is for a candidate eliminated or already elected, the current value of the vote shall be transferred to the voter’s next eligible preference.
In the event that two (2) senate candidates have the same amount of votes for the last available senate seat, the candidate with the most votes in the first (1st) round shall be declared the winner. If there is also an equal number of votes in the first (1st) round between the two (2) tied candidates, the candidate with the most votes in the proceeding round shall be declared the winner of the last available senate seat.
Pursuant to the ASUCD Constitution, instant runoff voting (IRV) shall be used to elect the ASUCD Student Advocate, the ASUCD External Affairs Vice President, the ASUCD Transfer Student Representative, and the ASUCD International Student Representative.
In instant runoff voting, the tabulation of votes proceeds in rounds. In each round, a value of one (1) vote is assigned to each voter’s highest remaining preference. For the Student Advocate, EAVP, TSR, or ISR to be elected, the required number of votes is a majority of the votes in that round. If a voter’s preference is for the candidate with the lowest accrued vote total, that candidate is eliminated, and the vote is transferred to the next preferred candidate still in the running. This process is completed when one (1) ticket receives the required majority of votes.
Creative Media and the Elections Committee shall maintain a permanent website that includes an explanation of the instant runoff voting and single transferable voting systems used in ASUCD Elections. This website shall also include a complete description of the algorithms that shall be used to tabulate the votes and/or the name of any software that shall be used to carry out the algorithm. Any changes to the tabulation process must be made on the website at least four (4) weeks prior to an election.
Pursuant to Article III of the ASUCD Constitution, the Elections Committee shall authorize the public release of the ballot ranking data the same day that the results of the vote tally are announced so that independent verification of the vote tally may be performed.

A proposal to allocate funding from the Better Business Practices/Pilot Programs line item may be submitted to the Office of the Controller and Internal Affairs Commission by any ASUCD member and/or ASUCD employee/staff, hereinafter referred to as “the applicant.
Eligible proposals may be reviewed by the Internal Affairs Commission where the proposal may be: (1) recommended to proceed as proposed, (2) recommended to proceed with amendments and/or restrictions, (3) rejected due to incomplete information, or (4) rejected.
Proposals rejected for reasons other than incomplete information shall not be reconsidered during the same quarter it was previously proposed, unless exempted by either the ASUCD Controller or Internal Affairs Commission Chairperson or Vice Chairperson. All proposals, once reviewed and regardless of the recommendation, shall be sent to the ASUCD Controller. The ASUCD Controller may not approve a rejected proposal but may return the proposal to the commission with amendments and/or restrictions, or as proposed for reconsideration in accordance with this chapter.
Once a proposal has been reviewed by the Internal Affairs Commission, it shall then be sent to the ASUCD Controller along with notes and recommendations from each of the commissioners, as well as any additional materials provided by the applicant for final approval.

The ASUCD Controller shall notify the Internal Affairs Commission Chairperson or Vice Chairperson, in writing, whenever funds are allocated via the process described in this chapter within twenty-four (24) hours of the allocation.
If the ASUCD President has declared a State of Emergency in accordance with the chapter on Emergency Procedures, the Better Business Practices/Pilot Programs budget shall be temporarily redesignated as an emergency fund. This would waive the allocation and use limits specified in the chapter on Emergency Procedures. If temporarily redesignated as an emergency use fund, the Internal Affairs Commission Chairperson or Vice Chairperson must be notified via email in real time unless conditions make this impossible.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
ASUCD PERSONNEL POLICY

PURPOSE
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a short, comprehensive manual of policies and procedures governing casual/restricted employment within ASUCD. It is intended to assist ASUCD Activity Managers, supervisors, employees, and job applicants by clearly defining how ASUCD shall implement the University of California Staff Personnel Policy in the recruitment of casual/restricted employees.
This chapter supplements, but does not replace, the UCD Staff Personnel Manual, the CUE-University of California Agreement, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) University of California Agreement (available in the ASUCD ASUCD Headquarters (HQ) Office), which apply to all ASUCD employees. Specific references to Staff Personnel Policy or employment-related matters not addressed in the ASUCD Bylaws shall be directed to the ASUCD Business Manager, who shall provide information, referral, or assistance.
DEFINITIONS
Employee: For the purposes of the ASUCD Personnel Policy, "employee” means a hired person in a casual/restricted position. "Employee" does not refer to career employees within the ASUCD Bylaws; career employees are governed by applicable University Policy. (For definitions of “career” and “casual/restricted,” refer to Personnel Policy for Staff Members 3.)
Job Title: A job title is an official title under which a person is employed. It is used in budgeting and in advertising for recruitment.
Ending Date: An ending date is a date when employment automatically terminates. All stipend positions within ASUCD must have an ending date not later than September 30 of the current fiscal year. Unless otherwise specified in the ASUCD Bylaws, hourly positions should be hired indefinitely unless the employee is to be hired for a specific amount of time. This shall avoid employees being dropped from payroll due to a failure to extend the ending date.
Hourly wage positions: A person employed in an hourly wage position receives a specific wage for each hour of work performed.
Stipend positions: A monetary stipend is provided for some positions to partially compensate a person for time and effort spent in the service of an activity. It is assumed that persons who occupy stipend positions receive personal and/or educational benefits from their work.
Independent Contractor positions: A person engaged as an Independent Contractor is not an employee and the provisions of this policy or of Staff Personnel Policy do not apply.
Hourly Contract positions: Certain hourly positions that do not fit into the concept of the Assistant Series or are short in duration are considered independent contracts for a specific number of hours. An example is a poll worker for an ASUCD Election.
Commissioned positions: These are positions where the work generates advertising sales, radio sponsorships, or other selected revenue-producing functions with which the person is compensated by a percentage of the revenue generated (for example, the KDVS Advertising Manager).
Per Column Inch positions: These positions exist solely in the newspaper media; reporters and staff writers are paid a rate for all column inches published on articles they have written.
Assignment Pay positions: A person in this position receives a sum of money for the completion of a particular task or assignment. The criteria used to differentiate between assignment pay positions and stipend positions include the level of responsibility, the time necessary to complete the task and the nature of the task, or assignment.
Work-Study: This program allows eligible students to earn part of a financial aid award and departments to employ students at a reduced rate. The department pays only a portion of the Work-Study employee’s wages, with the remaining portion paid by federal funds up to the amount of the student’s Work-Study award. The percentage to be paid by the department varies from year to year [usually twenty percent (20%)], depending upon the amount of Work-Study funds available. Department funds from any source, including most federal contracts and grant funds, may be used for the department’s matching share.
ASUCD Personnel Assistant: The ASUCD Personnel Assistant is a career employee. This person is located in Room 365 of the Memorial Union (the ASUCD ASUCD Headquarters Office). The Personnel Assistant handles the recruitment for all casual/restricted positions within ASUCD except Work-Study, which is handled by the Student Employment Center.
Activity Manager: Activity Managers are composed of, but not limited to, ASUCD Unit Directors, Unit Managers, and those in charge of other ASUCD programs who are authorized to hire employees.
All ASUCD Units may only have one (1) Unit Director. This Unit Director is responsible for representing the needs and interests of the Unit and for the smooth business operations of their respective Units.
Any subordinate director positions shall be appointed at the discretion of the Unit Director. The Unit Director may decide their relevant purview and jurisdiction.
The Unit Director must prepare the Unit’s annual operating budget for the fiscal year.
The ASUCD Internal Vice President and ASUCD President shall not be considered unit directors.
The ASUCD Internal Vice President shall be considered the activity manager for the ASUCD Senate and its subordinate bodies, in the absence of a chair or similar head of any subordinate body.
The ASUCD President shall be considered the activity manager for the ASUCD Executive Office and for all matters pertinent to ASUCD and any external bodies.
Student Employment Center: The Student Employment Center is located in Dutton Hall. This office handles the recruitment of casual positions in all departments except ASUCD.
Vacancy Listing: The Vacancy Listing Form is the official form displayed on campus and on the ASUCD website to advertise job vacancies.
Request for Vacancy Listing: The Request for Vacancy Listing form is the first form to be completed in order to begin the recruitment process. The form must contain a brief job description and all other specific information pertaining to the job vacancy. The form must be completed and signed by the Activity Manager or designee and the ASUCD Business Manager.
Final Filing Date: The Final Filing Date (FFD) is the date stated on the vacancy listing form which signifies the last day applications shall be accepted by the ASUCD Headquarters (HQ) Office for a given position.
Job Description: The Job Description Form provides a statement of all job duties and responsibilities under which an individual is employed. Job descriptions allow an employee to know exactly what is expected of an employee in that position and are used in determining stipend and hourly wage rates. Job descriptions are to be kept on file by the Activity Manager and the ASUCD Personnel Assistant. Job descriptions shall be given to employees during their orientations and shall be evaluated and/or updated annually by each Unit’s director. The Activity Director shall submit an updated job description to the Personnel Assistant by the end of winter quarter.
Forms: All forms used for personnel purposes may be obtained from the Personnel Assistant located in Room 365 of the Memorial Union (the Business Office).
NONDISCRIMINATION (AFFIRMATIVE ACTION)
Nondiscrimination in Employment: ASUCD shall follow the Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy of the University of California, Davis. As amended on January 1, 2004, Personnel Policy for Staff Members twelve (12) reads: "It is the policy of the University not to engage in discrimination against or harassment of any person employed by or seeking employment with the University of California on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or status as a covered veteran. This policy is intended to be consistent with the provisions of applicable State and Federal laws and University policies."
Diversity Encouragement: The strengths of diverse social backgrounds and opinions within the association are supported by ASUCD and its Activity Managers shall attempt to encourage a diverse applicant pool during the recruitment process.
RECRUITMENT
Positions for Students
General Policy: "Any position that is established for less than 50% time, or for a period that falls entirely within the summer quarter, is reserved for students unless an exception is obtained from a Recruiter in Human Resources." (Staff Policy for Personnel Members, UCD Procedure 3, Exhibit A, II. A. 1.).
Student Leadership Positions: Certain positions have been defined as Student Leadership Positions and must be filled by enrolled students only. These positions include all elected ASUCD positions, media heads, and other positions in which the incumbent officially represents ASUCD and/or the campus or plays an advocacy role for students. A current list of Student Leadership Positions is available from the ASUCD Main Office.
Exceptions to this policy may only be granted by the Vice Chancellor - Student Affairs. Such exceptions may be granted for one (1) quarter only on the basis of hardship to ASUCD or to individual students.
The Office of the Vice Chancellor - Student Affairs shall verify the registration status of incumbents in Student Leadership Positions each quarter.
Recruitment Procedures
Request for Vacancy Listing Form: The first step in recruitment is for the Activity Manager to submit a Request for Vacancy Listing for review and approval by the ASUCD Business Manager. The ASUCD President, Business Manager, and Human Resources Coordinator shall submit requests for vacancy listings for managerial positions. The Activity Manager or their designee must sign the form.
All positions must have a Final Filing Date (FFD), unless the Business Manager has approved an exception. All positions must be posted for at least one (1) week.
Stipends must be posted no later than September 30th of the current fiscal year. Unless otherwise specified in the ASUCD Bylaws, hourly employees are hired indefinitely unless an employee is hired for a defined period of time.
The pay rate for hourly positions must be the minimum pay rate established for the job title unless a higher rate has been approved by the Business Manager or the employee has earned longevity increases in a previous position at the same level.
The responsible Activity Manager or the Activity Manager’s designee may examine the file of applications within the Business Office at any time during the recruitment period. However, screening of interviews may not begin until the recruitment period is over.
Vacancy Listing Form: Following approval of the Request for Vacancy Listing, the Personnel Assistant prepares a Vacancy Listing Form. Vacancy Listings must be reviewed and approved by the Business Manager or designee. Jobs may not be advertised in any media until an approved Vacancy Listing has been posted.
Advertisement: Advertisement procedures are designed to recruit qualified applicants from the entire campus community. The ASUCD Personnel Assistant is responsible for the following:
All Vacancy Listings are posted on the main ASUCD Job Board (located on the Third Floor of the MU outside the Mee Room). Brief listings of vacancies are located on the First Floor MU bulletin board, and South Hall bulletin board.
Jobs are occasionally listed on the ASUCD Job Opportunities column in The California Aggie. Activities are encouraged to advertise independently for positions in which some difficulty is anticipated in recruiting applicants.
Employment Applications
Application forms are available on the ASUCD job board and in South Hall, and on the ASUCD website.

ASUCD CO-SPONSORSHIP POLICY


PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to lay the basis for equitable arrangements between all ASUCD Programming Units and student organizations concerning co-sponsored entertainment events, while providing enough flexibility so as to encourage a wide range of student organizations to participate in campus programming and production. This policy shall also explain the procedures involved in initiating and obtaining ASUCD co-sponsorship.

DEFINITIONS

Student Organizations: Any student-affiliated campus organization registered through the Center for Student Involvement (CSI) or ASUCD Department of Outreach and Recruitment.

ASUCD Programming Unit: Any ASUCD Unit whose purpose is to provide and produce campus entertainment events for students on a regular basis.

Entertainment Events: Any concert, lecture, presentation, film, or other on-campus programming event offering extra-curricular entertainment or education.

POLICY
Student organizations may enter into a co-sponsorship agreement with an ASUCD Programming Unit only if the student organization follows the procedures outlined below and meets the appropriate standards as agreed upon with the ASUCD Programming Unit Director, ASUCD Business Manager, and ASUCD Controller.

PROCEDURES

There are two (2) basic types of co-sponsorships:

Name-Only Co-Sponsorships: Student organizations may set up name-only co-sponsorships for eligible events by meeting with the ASUCD Programming Unit Director, the ASUCD Business Manager, and the ASUCD Controller to agree upon the amount of labor and capital or materials if applicable in return for publicity for their organization(s). Programming Units are encouraged to publicize lists of scheduled events so that Student Organizations shall be aware of the events forthcoming.

Self-Initiated Co-Sponsorships: Student Organizations with a specific artist, group, or program concept for which they desire ASUCD’s support must submit an ASUCD Concert Plan and cover letter to the appropriate ASUCD Programming Unit Director. The cover letter must include a description of the event, its value to the campus, and the services, labor, capital, and/or funds the Student Organization is able to contribute to the event.

The ASUCD Programming Unit Director shall evaluate the budget and proposal to determine if the information is accurate and the proposal is reasonable. At that time, the ASUCD Programming Unit Director may reject or revise the ASUCD Concert Plan.

When the Programming Unit Director approves an ASUCD Concert Plan, they shall seek approval from the ASUCD Business Manager and ASUCD Controller.

This letter of agreement shall establish the responsibilities of the ASUCD and of the Student Organization and shall agree upon percentages for the ultimate division of net profits or losses.

If the budgeted expenses exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), a security deposit in the form of a certified check (or another form as deemed satisfactory by the ASUCD Business Manager) from the Student Organization shall be required. The amount of the deposit shall be twenty-five (25) percent (25%) of the budgeted expenses.

In the event of a financial loss, the security deposit shall be retained either wholly or partially as commensurate with the Student Organization’s previously established financial responsibility for the event. If the amount of the deposit does not cover the financial responsibility of the Student Organization, the organization shall be expected to make up all differences under terms negotiable with the ASUCD Business Manager and ASUCD Controller as per the co-sponsorship agreement.

In the event that the maximum amount of funding from Club Finance Council (CFC) has been reached, a Student Organization may seek from the ASUCD Senate or other entity additional funds or co-sponsorship with a letter of support from the Club Finance Council Board. A registered Student Organization may be funded through ASUCD without exhausting its funding through CFC only if a social and/or political event transpires after the appropriate deadline for funding through CFC, and the organization finds it necessary to immediately address the issue.

Any co-sponsorship proposal shall be rejected if:

The ASUCD Programming Unit Director, the ASUCD Business Manager, or the ASUCD Controller determine that there is a clear lack of empirical evidence indicating the success of the event; or

There are scheduling conflicts with other campus programming events that may be detrimental to all events; or

The ASUCD Business Manager, ASUCD Controller, or the ASUCD Programming Unit Director feel that the Student Organization may be unable to bear its share of the financial burden should the event end up with a net loss; or

The event is eligible to receive a grant from Cultural Days; or

The registered Student Organization has not exhausted funding opportunities with Club Finance Council (CFC) before requesting funding or co-sponsorship from any Unit or program of ASUCD including the Senate.

CHAPTER THIRTY
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to offer guidelines to ASUCD units and officials in the event of a campus emergency.
DEFINITIONS
Emergency: An extreme event, defined as an external complication that has a significant and negative impact on any UC Davis campus and/or ASUCD’s ability to function
STATE OF EMERGENCY
The ASUCD President, with a two-thirds (⅔) majority approval of all members of the Cabinet, Senate President Pro Tempore, Student Advocate, and Business Manager may declare a State of Emergency for the ASUCD.
Should ASUCD services be impacted due to a State of Emergency, all decisions regarding ASUCD business practices shall be made in consultation with the ASUCD Management Team and shall be communicated to the ASUCD Senate no more than twelve (24) hours after the decision has been made.
An ASUCD State of Emergency may only be declared when either the United States of America, the State of California, the County of Yolo, or an adjacent county, the City of Davis, or the University of California, Davis has also declared or entered a State of Emergency for either the same or related reason(s).
A State of Emergency may be ended by the ASUCD President, in consultation with the Senate Pro Tempore and with majority approval of the Cabinet, or by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of the ASUCD Senate.
A State of Emergency may be ended by the ASUCD President, in consultation with the Senate Pro Tempore, Business Manager, and with majority approval of the Cabinet, or by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of the ASUCD Senate.
The ASUCD Business Manager may reverse a declaration of a State of Emergency should they feel that it is being abused.
BUSINESS PRACTICES
Temporary Emergency Business Practices: Together, the ASUCD Controller, ASUCD Business Manager, and ASUCD President in active consultation with the Internal Affairs Commission Vice Chairperson of Regulation and Finance may, during an ASUCD State of Emergency, institute temporary emergency policies regarding business practices and the use of or restriction of ASUCD controlled funds. It shall be the duty of the Controller to keep the ASUCD Senate aware of all temporary emergency business practices. Unless deemed necessary by the Business Manager, these temporary emergency business practices shall cease to be enforced once the State of Emergency has ended.

Should a temporary policy be found to be improper or beyond the reach of the Emergency powers granted to the ASUCD Controller or ASUCD Business Manager by the Senate President Pro Tempore, the ASUCD Senate may move to conduct a vote to override the policy in question at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the ASUCD Senate and shall be subject to a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote.
If the temporary policies have been found to be in malpractice, they shall be considered a violation of all relevant sections of the ASUCD governing documents and be subject to all relevant sections of the ASUCD governing documents regarding personnel and disciplinary procedures.
Unit Shutdowns: Unit shutdowns shall occur at the discretion of the ASUCD Management Team in consultation with that Unit’s leadership and the ASUCD Senate.

SUSPENSION OF GOVERNING DOCUMENT OBLIGATIONS
In line with the ASUCD Principles of Community, should there be any conflict between our governing documents and the well-being of the UC Davis student body, the needs of the student body shall prevail.
The suspension of the appropriate sections of the governing documents shall be immediately communicated to the ASUCD Senate. Objection to a specific suspension of the governing documents brought forward by an ASUCD Senator shall be subject to a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the Senate in order to suspend the aforementioned section of the governing documents.
Any relevant sections regarding the conduct of personnel, as well as the removal of personnel shall not be suspended.
STUDENT SERVICES
ASUCD shall continue to provide essential services (i.e. food support and transportation services) for as long as is reasonable during an emergency.
Should the continuation or expansion of services be deemed necessary by the ASUCD Management Team, the ASUCD Management Team in consultation with the IAC Vice Chair of Regulation and Finance can agree to pull out the necessary reserves to fund ASUCD services with a majority vote.
The determination by the ASUCD Management Team and IAC Vice Chair to utilize necessary reserves to fund ASUCD services or maintain the status of reserves may be overturned by a simple majority of the ASUCD Senate.
VIRTUAL ATTENDANCE
In the event that the ASUCD Senate is not able to physically convene due to a declared State of Emergency, the Presiding Officer may conduct Senate meetings in a transparent, publically accessible online format. This may be via virtual meetings or other methods.
If the Senate meeting is to take place online, the presiding officer is required to announce the Senate meeting, and the platform being utilized to conduct the said meeting, to the public at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the scheduled meeting.
When the agenda has been posted, it is the responsibility of the presiding officer to ensure the means for the public to make public comments on the online platform.
